            Adding a local database to search works
            only in the secure server at https://jpts.aprx.io.
            At the moment,local database results are shown only in Search by Gematria Value.
            It will be a part of Distance Measure Search also, in the future.
            Safari doesn't like local files for security reasons, but with Google Chrome it works.
            The data should be in a plain text file. A parsing algorithm takes care of
            capital letters, special characters, numbers and whitespace, so almost any text can be used.
            Choose a file from your device with the file browser that opens from the button above.
            The words from the file are shown below words found from Wizard's DeepMem database in
            Search by Gematria Value.

        <p>
            The contents of the database are shown below this text after the file is uploaded.
