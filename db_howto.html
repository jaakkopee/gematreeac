            Adding the local database functions only in the secure server at https://jpts.aprx.io.
            The data should be in a plain text file, one word on a row, with no whitespace and no special characters or numbers.
            Choose the right file from your device with the file browser that opens from the button above.
            The words in the file are taken as a part of Wizard Meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The contents of the database are shown here after the file is uploaded.
