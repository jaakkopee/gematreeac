            Adding the local database to Wizard Meditation Search works only in the secure server at https://jpts.aprx.io. Safari doesn't like local files for security reasons, but with Google Chrome it works.
            The data should be in a plain text file. A parsing algorithm takes care of capital letters, special characters, numbers and whitespace.
            Choose a file from your device with the file browser that opens from the button above.
            The words from the file are shown below words found from Wizard's DeepMem database in Wizard Meditation Search.

            The contents of the database are shown below this text after the file is uploaded.
