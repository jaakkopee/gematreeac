# GemaTreeAC 2=0
GemaTreeAC 2=0 is a gematria and numerology -based word classification algorithm and database. It is meant for searching meanings of words by mapping letters into numbers and comparing the values of words. Also numerological reduction is used to form a nine-rooted treestructure that has routes of numbers from leave to root. The code is also a web application that is hosted at http://gematreeac.ga

Gematria is the mapping of numbers (usually positive integers) with the letters of an alphabet.
Gematria is used for searching associative meanings in words in the study of the Bible and the Torah, for example.
I use it to construct words of power for my ritual work.

For classification of the numbers of selected words, GemaTreeAC utilizes a technique called numerological reduction.
For example, the numbers 666 and 333 are seen as numerologically related. All numbers can be reduced numerologically into parent numbers. When numerological reduction is iterated until the resulting number is a single-digit number what we have is what I call the root number, that is, a number with a single digit (numbers 1 to 9). If the parent number is the same with two different numbers, they are seen as numerologically related.

For example, the numerological reduction for numbers 666 and 333 is calculated as follows: 666 reduces to 6+6+6=18 and 18 reduces to 1+8=9. 333 reduces straight to 3+3+3=9. The numbers have the same root and are therefore related. The numbers have different routes to their root.

When numerological reduction is iterated multiple times, the numbers travel in a tree-like structure that has nine roots (numbers 1 to 9). Between the leaf numbers (666 and 333 in our example) and the root numbers (now only one, a common root: 9) it can be seen the numbers travel the tree from leaf to root on varying routes that converge as the number of digits in numbers decrease. The routes to root in my example are [666, 18, 9] and [333, 9].

To analyze this behavior I came up with the idea of n-digit sets. It is a grouping of values according to the number of digits in the numerical representations of values. The number 666 travels through n-digit sets n=3, n=2 to the set n=1. 333 travels straight from n=3 to n=1. The n-digit set n=1 has all the numbers, for every number has a root number. The higher the n in a given n-digit set, the smaller the probability of a certain number to appear in this set although the number of numbers in the set is greater. I’m not gifted enough in mathematics to formulate this phenomenon properly. The numbers go through n-digit sets in varying, interesting patterns.

There is a reason why, in kabbala, the low n-digit numbers are considered as powerful, even sacred. The amount of words related to a low n-digit number is higher than to a number with a higher number of digits. This means that by one special low n-digit word, a kabbalist can conjure up hundreds of meaningful associations (related words). Words with high amount of associations are called "words of power”. These words can be used in mantras, spells, prayers and prophecies.

All numbers and all words can be mapped to the tree of life, the main symbol of kabbalists. It is a composite symbol consisting of 11 sephiras and 22 paths. The sephiras represent the numbers 1 to 11 and the 22 paths represent the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Numbers 10 and 11 are special. Number 10, representing matter, is viewed as the mirror of sephira 1, representing spirit. Number 11 is the number of the ”hidden” sephira that has special functions in the tree.

All numbers have occult meanings in the tree of life. Number nine is called ”The Foundation”. It represents sexuality, the astral and the subconscious. It’s planetary association is the moon. Number one (”The Crown”) represents consciousness. Numbers in set n=1 have very specific cognitive functions attributed to them. Higher-n numbers have more complex and also vague meanings as their meanings are composites of the meanings of numbers in set n=1. The higher the n, the more room is left for interpretation.

At the moment GemaTreeAC has only 8 ciphers that are used commonly in gematria study. I’d like to add more, hopefully original ciphers that work with gematria (produce lots of interesting associative meanings). I also want to develop and refine the data representation in GemaTreeAC. The nine-rooted tree is there already. The numbers are studied only by equivalence at the moment. I’d want to give the user tools for exploration of farther numerological relations. Via study of nwcp:s (numbers with common parents) other numerological relations can be explored.

GemaTreeAC comes with database functionality and a database called DeepMem of ca. 500000 words in Finnish, Swedish and English. DeepMem-database is gatherd from kotus-sanalista_v1, WordNet 3.1, Gothenburg uni. Saldo 2.3 and Väestötietojärjestelmän Etunimitilasto
